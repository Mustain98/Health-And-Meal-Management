Health and Meal Manager
Project Overview: This project aims to help users manage their overall health by offering a smart, personalized meal planning and tracking system. The application generates tailored nutrition goals — including daily calorie intake, protein, carbohydrate, and fat targets — based on each user's physical profile, health conditions, daily activities, and desired goals (such as weight loss, muscle gain, or maintenance).
The system empowers users to:
•	Design Custom Meal Plans based on real-time nutritional needs.
•	Get food recommendations for each meal to meet specific macro and calorie targets.
•	Track daily intake progress and visually monitor how much of their nutritional demands have been fulfilled.
•	Receive notifications when:
o	Macronutrients are below or above target limits.
o	The diet plan is imbalanced or inconsistent with the user's health goals.
This project can serve as both a health monitor and a meal planner, supporting users in making informed decisions about their daily nutrition while tracking their health progress over time.
